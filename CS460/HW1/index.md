## Homework 1

For the first assignment, we got the task of creating a series of simple web pages and styling them using CSS and Bootstrap. I have studied HTML during summer vacation, but I know nothing about bootstrap and css, so I must start early before class.

I have never used Git before, so the class start, I need to find information from the Internet to preview what git is. On the first day, I was anxious because I was afraid that I couldnâ€™t follow the class, but I feel a little easier when I knew what git was and how to use it.
